## Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and here is the link
* [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dev523/leaf-disease-detection-dataset/data)
  Almost 71000 images were used for training.
* We did some data augmentation like flipping and rotation to get better results.
* 90% of dataset was used for training. 10% for validation.
## Resolution
The  image resolution  is 512*512.
